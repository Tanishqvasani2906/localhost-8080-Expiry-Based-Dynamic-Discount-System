# Expiry-Based Dynamic Discount System

## Problem Statement

Pricing strategies for products and services often remain static, leading to inefficiencies in sales and revenue generation. Our goal is to implement a **dynamic discounting system** that adjusts prices based on time-sensitive factors, increasing sales efficiency and reducing wastage.

## Our Approach

We have designed a **multi-category dynamic pricing system** that applies different discounting strategies based on product type:

1. **Perishable Goods** (Implemented ✅): Discounts increase as expiry approaches to prevent waste.
2. **Event-Based Products** (Static Data 📊): Prices increase as event dates approach, with rare last-minute discounts.
3. **Subscription Services** (Static Data 📊): Discounts based on user behavior, engagement, and renewal history.
4. **Seasonal/Time-Limited Products** (Static Data 📊): Higher prices in peak season, clearance discounts post-season.

## What We Have Implemented So Far

✅ **[06/03/2025 | 12:00 AM]** Successfully implemented **dynamic pricing for perishable goods.**

- Admin panel allows adding perishable products (restricted access).
- Discounts are automatically calculated based on expiry date.
- Hosted Backend & Frontend for live testing.

🚧 **Other three categories are currently loading static data.**

> 📌 **Live Demonstration Available:** If anyone wants to see a real-time demo of perishable products dynamic pricing, feel free to contact us.
